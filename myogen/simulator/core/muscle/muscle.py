def _perform_fast_marching(
    speed_map: np.ndarray, seed_points: np.ndarray
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Perform fast marching using scikit-fmm to compute distance maps.

    This function implements the Fast Marching Method to solve the Eikonal equation,
    which is used to distribute innervation centers optimally within the muscle cross-section.
    The method ensures that innervation centers are spaced as far apart as possible from
    each other, mimicking the natural distribution of motor unit territories.

    Parameters
    ----------
    speed_map : np.ndarray
        2D speed map (inverse of a density map) defining the propagation speed
        at each grid point. Higher values indicate faster propagation.
        Should be > 1e-10 for valid regions and ≤ 1e-10 for invalid regions.
    seed_points : np.ndarray
        Seed points as 2×N array where each column is a point [x, y].
        Uses 1-based indexing like MATLAB. These are the starting points
        for the distance computation.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Distance map from seed points. Each element represents the minimum
        distance to any of the seed points. Invalid regions (outside the
        circular muscle boundary) are set to -1e10.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is used internally by the muscle distribution algorithm
    to implement a greedy approach for placing innervation centers such that
    each new electrode_grid_center is placed at the location farthest from all previously
    placed centers.
    """
    # Create a mask for valid regions (inside the circular domain)
    valid_mask = speed_map > 1e-10

    # Create a signed distance function for the domain
    # Initialize with large positive values (far from boundary)
    phi = np.ones_like(speed_map) * 1000.0

    # Set seed points to 0 (starting points for Fast Marching)
    for i in range(seed_points.shape[1]):
        x, y = int(seed_points[0, i] - 1), int(seed_points[1, i] - 1)
        # Ensure indices are within bounds
        if 0 <= x < speed_map.shape[0] and 0 <= y < speed_map.shape[1]:
            phi[x, y] = 0.0  # Starting points

class Muscle:
    """
    A muscle model based on the cylindrical description of the volume conductor by Farina et al. 2004 [1]_ and the motor unit distribution by Konstantin et al. 2020 [2]_.

    .. note::
        All default values are set to simulate the First Dorsal Interosseous (FDI) muscle. Values are pulled from the literature.

    Parameters
    ----------
    recruitment_thresholds : np.ndarray
        Array of recruitment thresholds for each motor unit (see `myogen.simulator.generate_mu_recruitment_thresholds`).
        Values range from 0 to 1 with the largest motor units having thresholds near 1.
    radius__mm : float, default=6.91
        Radius of the muscle cross-section in millimeters. Default is set to 6.91 mm as determined by Jacobson et al. 1992 [3]_.

        Density of muscle fibers per square millimeter. Default is set to 400 fibers/mm² as determined by no one.
    max_innervation_area_to_total_muscle_area__ratio : float, default=0.25
        Ratio defining the maximum territory size relative to total muscle area.
        Default is set to 0.25 as determined by no one but it is a good starting point.
        A value of 0.25 means the largest motor unit can innervate up to 25%
        of the total muscle cross-sectional area.
        Must be in range (0, 1].
    mean_conduction_velocity__m_s : float, default=4.2
        Mean conduction velocity in m/s. Default is set to 4.2 m/s as determined by Nishizono et al. 1990 [4]_.
        Experimental range determined by Nishizono et al. 1990 [4]_ is between 3.2 and 5.0 m/s.
    mean_fiber_length__mm : float, default=31.7
        Mean fiber length in mm. Default is set to 31.7 mm as determined by Jacobson et al. 1992 [3]_ (Table 1).

    radius_bone__mm : float, default=0
        Bone radius in mm. Default is set to 0 mm as the FDI muscle doesn't surround a bone.
    fat_thickness__mm : float, default=0.3
        Fat thickness in mm. Default is set to 0.3 mm as determined by Störchle et al. 2018 [5]_.

        Muscle conductivity in radial direction. Default is set to 0.09 S/m as determined by Botelho et al. 2019 [7]_ (Table 1).
    muscle_conductivity_longitudinal__S_m : float, default=0.4
        Muscle conductivity in longitudinal direction. Default is set to 0.4 S/m as determined by Botelho et al. 2019 [7]_ (Table 1).

    grid_resolution : int, default=256
        Resolution of the computational grid used for innervation the muscle.
        Higher values provide more accurate spatial distribution but increase computational cost.
        Default is set to 256.
    autorun : bool, default=False
        If True, automatically executes the complete muscle simulation pipeline: innervation distribution, muscle fiber generation, and fiber-to-motor unit assignment.
        If False, these steps must be called manually.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If max_innervation_area_to_total_muscle_area__ratio is not in (0, 1].

        The assignment uses a probabilistic approach where each fiber is assigned
        based on the posterior probability computed from prior probabilities (target
        fiber numbers) and likelihoods (spatial clustering with Gaussian territories).

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_neighbours : int, default 3
            Number of neighboring fibers to consider for self-avoiding phenomena.
            Higher values increase intermingling between motor units but may slow
            computation. Typical range: 2-5.
        conf : float, default 0.999
            Confidence interval that defines the relationship between innervation
            area and Gaussian distribution variance. Higher values create tighter,
            more compact territories. Should be between 0.9 and 0.999.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            Results are stored in self.assignment as an array of length n_fibers
            where each element indicates the motor unit index (0 to n_motor_units-1)
            assigned to that fiber.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If innervation_center_positions is None. Call distribute_innervation_centers()
            first.

        Notes
        -----
        The algorithm compensates for out-of-muscle effects by calculating how much
        of each motor unit's Gaussian distribution falls outside the circular muscle
        boundary and adjusting the in-muscle probabilities accordingly.

        The self-avoidance mechanism promotes realistic intermingling by reducing
        the probability of assigning a fiber to a motor unit if its neighbors are
        already assigned to that unit.
